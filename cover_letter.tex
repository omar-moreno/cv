    Dear [Name], \\[11pt]

    I'm interested in the [position]. I am a graduate student in particle 
    physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz and will be completing
    my PhD in the Spring.  As a member of the Heavy Photon Search collaboration, 
    my research has focused on the search for a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry of
    nature as well as detector R\&D of the HPS Silicon Vertex Tracker.

    I am sincerely interested in the opportunity to join [institution] because
    of the [nice things].

    I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you and other [people] and
    would be happy to provide any additional information about myself. Please 
    contact me should you have any questions.  Thank you for your time and 
    consideration of my application.

    Sincerely, \\[11pt]
